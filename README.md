## Express Challenge/Notes app

Due to unforseen circumstances with heroku, the app was not able to be deployed. A demo video is provided as a substitute. 
The user is greeted with a welcome page that has a button leading them to the notes app. On load, the previous notes are loaded to the left,
and there is empty fields to write in on the right. After entering in characters in both fields, the user is able to use the save icon in the
top right corner in order to save their note to the database.
